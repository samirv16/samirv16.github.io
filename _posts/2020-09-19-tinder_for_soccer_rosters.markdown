I will be starting my first collaborative project this next week, and as of now I would just like to talk about the concept for it.
A soccer buddy of mine that is a senior dev thought of the idea, and thought it would be a fun project for us to do for my portfolio. I really like the idea because i can see it being used with the adult soccer community in the future. So here it goes: We want to to have a tinder like platform that allows captains to pick soccer player from a database based on certain parameters (age, position, formation, skill, etc). 

I think the idea is simple but the project will require different levels of complexity that will allow me to learn things I havent before. For example, we talked about finding an api and seeing what systems have an sdk so we can connect to it. Making the information a lot easier to work with. I will be writting about the experience as we go, Im excited to fail and learn! see you soon.
